Materials and methods: Descriptive observational study of an incident cohort. Population: Patients receiving dipyrone during their hospital stay. Quantitative analysis of incidents and description of dipyrone-associated adverse events. Results: Incidence of global adverse events=0.3% (in 48,946 doses of dipyrone prescribed to 2747 patients). No cases of Agranulocytosis. A total 100% non-severe adverse events. (All were associated with toxidermia). Conclusion: A low incidence of dipyrone-associated adverse events is reported. Optimal reporting of institutional adverse events is controversial, and the recommendation is to measure any adverse events with a more rigorous follow-up of patients using dipyrone, and a clear and specific standardization of the guidelines for improved prescription and medical control.

This study was designed to evaluate radiation dose exposure and utilization of dose-saving strategies for contrast-enhanced cardiac CTA in daily practice. Methods and results Sixty one hospitals from 32 countries prospectively enrolled 4502 patients undergoing cardiac CTA during one calendar month in 2017. Computed tomography angiography scan data and images were analysed in a central core lab and compared with a similar dose survey performed in 2007. Linear regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors associated with dose. The most frequent indication for cardiac CTA was the evaluation of coronary artery disease in 89% of patients. The median dose-length product (DLP) of coronary CTA was 195 mGy?cm (interquartile range 110-338 mGy?cm). When compared with 2007, the DLP was reduced by 78% (P < 0.001) without an increase in non-diagnostic coronary CTAs (1.7% in 2007 vs. 1.9% in 2017 surveys, P = 0.55). A 37-fold variability in median DLP was observed between the hospitals with lowest and highest DLP (range of median DLP 57-2090 mGy?cm). Independent predictors for radiation dose of coronary CTA were: body weight, heart rate, sinus rhythm, tube voltage, iterative image reconstruction, and the selection of scan protocols. Conclusion This large international radiation dose survey demonstrates considerable reduction of radiation exposure in coronary CTA during the last decade. However, the large inter-site variability in radiation exposure underlines the need for further site-specific training and adaptation of contemporary cardiac scan protocols.

Thus, the aims of this study were (1) to determine the patterns of commuting to and from school and (2) to analyze the associations between ACS, physical activity (PA), and sedentary habits in Ecuadorian youth. A total of 732 students (65.3% males), aged 10–18 years (children = 246, young adolescents = 310, older adolescents = 162) from the central region of Ecuador participated in this study. A self-report questionnaire, including the usual mode and frequency of commuting, distance from home to school (PACO-Questionnaire), and PA and sedentary habits (YAP-Questionnaire), was used. Most of the sample lived ?2 km from school; however, they were mainly passive commuters (96%). The most common mode of commuting was by car (to school = 43.4%, from school = 31.6%; p < 0.001).

Materials and Methods: Patients with clinically localized PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and had preoperative mp-MRI between May-2011 and December- 2013. Mp-MRI was evaluated according to the European Society of Urogenital Radiology MRI prostate guidelines by two different readers. Histopathological RP results were the standard reference. Results: 79 patients were included; mean age was 61 and median preoperative prostate- specific antigen (PSA) 7.0. On MRI, 28% patients had ECE evidenced in the mp-MRI, 5% seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) and 4% lymph node involvement (LNI). At RP, 39.2% had ECE, 26.6% SVI and 12.8% LNI. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of mp-MRI for ECE were 54.9%, 90.9%, 76%, 81% and 74.1% respectively; for SVI values were 19.1%, 100%, 77.3%, 100% and 76.1% respectively and for LNI 20%, 98.4%, 86.7%, 66.7% and 88.7%. Conclusions: Major surgical decisions are made with digital rectal exam (DRE) and ultrasound studies before the use of Mp-MRI.

Toxoplasmosis is a major cause of visual defects in the Colombian population; however, the association between genetic polymorphisms in cytokine genes and susceptibility to ocular toxoplasmosis has not been studied in this population. This work evaluates the associations between polymorphisms in genes coding for the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?) (rs1799964, rs1800629, rs1799724, rs1800630, and rs361525), interleukin 1? (IL-1?) (rs16944, rs1143634, and rs1143627), IL-1? (rs1800587), gamma interferon (IFN-?) (rs2430561), and IL-10 (rs1800896 and rs1800871) and the presence of ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) in a sample of a Colombian population (61 patients with OT and 116 healthy controls). Genotyping was performed with the ""dideoxynucleotide (ddNTP) primer extension"" technique. Functional-effect predictions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were done by using FuncPred. A polymorphism in the IL-10 gene promoter (-1082G/A) was significantly more prevalent in OT patients than in controls (P = 1.93e-08; odds ratio [OR] = 5.27e+03; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.18 to 8.739; Bonferroni correction [BONF] = 3.48e-07). In contrast, haplotype ""AG"" of the IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms (rs1800896 and rs1800871) was present at a lower frequency in OT patients (P = 7e-04; OR = 0.10; 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.35). The +874A/T polymorphism of IFN-? was associated with OT (P = 3.37e-05; OR = 4.2; 95% CI = 2.478 to 7.12; BONF = 6.07e-04).

Toxoplasmosis is a major cause of visual defects in the Colombian population; however, the association between genetic polymorphisms in cytokine genes and susceptibility to ocular toxoplasmosis has not been studied in this population. This work evaluates the associations between polymorphisms in genes coding for the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?) (rs1799964, rs1800629, rs1799724, rs1800630, and rs361525), interleukin 1? (IL-1?) (rs16944, rs1143634, and rs1143627), IL-1? (rs1800587), gamma interferon (IFN-?) (rs2430561), and IL-10 (rs1800896 and rs1800871) and the presence of ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) in a sample of a Colombian population (61 patients with OT and 116 healthy controls). Genotyping was performed with the ""dideoxynucleotide (ddNTP) primer extension"" technique. Functional-effect predictions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were done by using FuncPred. A polymorphism in the IL-10 gene promoter (-1082G/A) was significantly more prevalent in OT patients than in controls (P = 1.93e-08; odds ratio [OR] = 5.27e+03; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.18 to 8.739; Bonferroni correction [BONF] = 3.48e-07). In contrast, haplotype ""AG"" of the IL-10 gene promoter polymorphisms (rs1800896 and rs1800871) was present at a lower frequency in OT patients (P = 7e-04; OR = 0.10; 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.35). The +874A/T polymorphism of IFN-? was associated with OT (P = 3.37e-05; OR = 4.2; 95% CI = 2.478 to 7.12; BONF = 6.07e-04).

Methods: Retrospective study of patients receiving at least one dose of the sustained-release dexamethasone implant between January 2012 and June 2016 in the private retinal practice of a referral center in Barranquilla, Colombia. Ocular hypertension was defined as an IOP ? 21 mmHg or an increase of at least 10 mmHg from baseline. The monthly change in IOP during 6 months of follow-up and the relationship with a previous diagnosis of glaucoma was evaluated. Results: Thirty-seven cases were reviewed, with an initial IOP between 9 and 22 mmHg. Hypertension during the 6 months of follow up with topical antihypertensive requirement was observed in 21 cases (56.7%). In 11 cases (29.7%) IOP increased to ? 21 mmHg, in 6 (16.2%) it increased ? 25 mmHg and, in four cases to ? 10 mmHg (10.8%) above the baseline IOP after the 1st month.

To aid the development of better understanding of these phenotypes, we performed a controlled longitudinal weight perturbation study combining multiple omics strategies (genomics, transcriptomics, multiple proteomics assays, metabolomics, and microbiomics) during periods of weight gain and loss in humans. Results demonstrated that: (1) weight gain is associated with the activation of strong inflammatory and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy signatures in blood; (2) although weight loss reverses some changes, a number of signatures persist, indicative of long-term physiologic changes; (3) we observed omics signatures associated with insulin resistance that may serve as novel diagnostics; (4) specific biomolecules were highly individualized and stable in response to perturbations, potentially representing stable personalized markers.

To aid the development of better understanding of these phenotypes, we performed a controlled longitudinal weight perturbation study combining multiple omics strategies (genomics, transcriptomics, multiple proteomics assays, metabolomics, and microbiomics) during periods of weight gain and loss in humans. Results demonstrated that: (1) weight gain is associated with the activation of strong inflammatory and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy signatures in blood; (2) although weight loss reverses some changes, a number of signatures persist, indicative of long-term physiologic changes; (3) we observed omics signatures associated with insulin resistance that may serve as novel diagnostics; (4) specific biomolecules were highly individualized and stable in response to perturbations, potentially representing stable personalized markers. Most data are available open access and serve as a valuable resource for the community.

The difference between preventing and transmitting waterborne diseases depends on several factors, such as the quality and continuity of the water supply service. Objective: To determine the performance of the índice de riesgo de la calidad del agua (water quality risk index, irca) for human consumption in urban areas of the department of Boyacá from 2004 to 2013. Methodology: Descriptive study. 122 aqueducts of the urban zones of the municipalities of the Boyacá department were included in the irca evaluation. The sample was taken according to established regulations and for this, technicians were trained in environmental sanitation. Physical, chemical and microbiological analyses were carried out (total coliforms, Escherichia coli, visible color, turbidity, pH and free residual chlorine). The variables analyzed were recorded in the water quality monitoring information system for human consumption (sivicap, as per its Spanish acronym). Statistical analysis of central trend measures and averages was also performed. Results: In 2004, in 122 municipalities of Boyacá, 77% had an irca at high risk and 23% at medium risk. Over time, there has been a decrease in the level of risk, 3% had high risk, 14% medium risk, 29% low risk and 54% were without risk in 2013. Conclusions: In the period studied in the department of Boyacá, the irca showed a tendency to decrease, going from high risk to low risk, possibly due to the implementation and intensification of environmental health surveillance actions carried out by the department’s Ministry of Health, such as health inspection visits, verification of good health practices, personalized training for treatment plant operators and permanent monitoring.

The difference between preventing and transmitting waterborne diseases depends on several factors, such as the quality and continuity of the water supply service. Objective: To determine the performance of the índice de riesgo de la calidad del agua (water quality risk index, irca) for human consumption in urban areas of the department of Boyacá from 2004 to 2013. Methodology: Descriptive study. 122 aqueducts of the urban zones of the municipalities of the Boyacá department were included in the irca evaluation. The sample was taken according to established regulations and for this, technicians were trained in environmental sanitation. Physical, chemical and microbiological analyses were carried out (total coliforms, Escherichia coli, visible color, turbidity, pH and free residual chlorine). The variables analyzed were recorded in the water quality monitoring information system for human consumption (sivicap, as per its Spanish acronym). Statistical analysis of central trend measures and averages was also performed. Results: In 2004, in 122 municipalities of Boyacá, 77% had an irca at high risk and 23% at medium risk. Over time, there has been a decrease in the level of risk, 3% had high risk, 14% medium risk, 29% low risk and 54% were without risk in 2013. Conclusions: In the period studied in the department of Boyacá, the irca showed a tendency to decrease, going from high risk to low risk, possibly due to the implementation and intensification of environmental health surveillance actions carried out by the department’s Ministry of Health, such as health inspection visits, verification of good health practices, personalized training for treatment plant operators and permanent monitoring.

Materials and methods: Case report of an 84-year-old patient who presented with an abdominal mass and urinary tract obstruction. During hospital stay, she developed intra-abdominal bleeding with signs of shock, requiring total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpyngo-oophorectomy, hypogastric artery ligation and pelvic packing as interventions to control bleeding. Histology reported a diagnosis of carcinosarcoma of the uterine cervix. The patient evolved adequately and was referred for oncologic management.

The search was limited by language type but not by year of publication. Results: A total of 19 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and they were predominantly case reports. The clinical stage most frequently reported was FIGO IB in close to 53% of cases, and the most frequent presentation was genital bleeding associated with a pelvic mass. With an average follow-up of 15 months, survival for this tumour is 17% for the patients receiving radiotherapy.

Purpose To describe a new syndrome due to repeated trauma to the penis, which is proposed to be called ""Chronic traumatic cavernopathy"" (CTC), with 4 components: fibrosis, erectile dysfunction, curvature and penile venous leakage. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on a database of 128 patients who had at least one penis ultrasound performed with a vasoactive, and had some degree of cavernous fibrosis according to Levine classification. An evaluation was made on the presence of erectile dysfunction, curvature, and venous leakage depending on the degree of fibrosis. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee. Results The study included 128 patients with penile fibrosis, and a mean age of 52.9 years (SD = 13). The degree of fibrosis was mild (Levine 1) in 30 (23.43%), moderate (Levine 2) in 23 (17.96%), and severe (Levine 3) in 75 (58.6%). It was shown that the higher the fibrosis, the more erectile dysfunction (ED), with 66.6%, 83.6%, and 96% for Levine 1, 2, and 3 respectively (P 0.0001). Frequency of secondary curvature (n = 71) was 0%, 4.2%, and 95.7% for Levine 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P 0.0001). The frequency in 44 cavernous patients with venous leakages was 9%, 20.4%, and 70.4% (P = 0.0060), and with 15 dorsal leakages it was 80%, 13.3%, and 6.6% (P < 0.0001) for Levine 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The group of 79 (64.03%) patients with increased possibility of CTC, and who met the 4 criteria, or the 3 criteria including secondary curvature and cavernous venous leakage, had a mean age of 59.2 years (SD = 8.7), compared to 41.7 years (SD = 11.7) in the other group with less possibility, which had a statistically significant difference (P 0.0001). Conclusions We propose that there is a syndrome of repeated micro-trauma in penis, which can be called CTC, analogous to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, with 4 components: cavernous fibrosis, erectile dysfunction, penile curvature, and venous leak. Fibrosis is a continuum that, in the patient goes through mild and moderate stages, and often goes unnoticed by clinicians. Secondary curvatures and cavernous leaks are directly related to the degree of fibrosis and increased risk of erectile dysfunction. Age aggravates some factors of CTC.

Excessive weight loss after bariatric surgery results in skin excess. Body contouring surgery corrects the functional and esthetic problems of these patients, although it has its complications. Our objective is to identify the associated factors for complications in patients undergoing post-bariatric contouring surgery. Demographics, comorbidities and surgical data were analyzed in a population sample collected among patients operated at our academic center in Medellín, Colombia. Methods. Retrospective and prospective data of 627 procedures in 512 patients were collected in a 4 years period. After a bivariate analysis, variables with a p ?0.25 were selected for the multivariate analysis. Logistic regression was estimated, proved and adjusted to identify independent variables associated with complications. Results. Of the 512 patients accepted, 67 procedures (10.7%) had a complication. Mean age was 41.22 ± 9.9 years. Mean pre-bariatric weight and body mass index (BMI) were 111.3 ± 19.6 kg and 46.1 ± 10.8 kg/m2 respectively. Mean post-bariatric weight and BMI were 69.9 ± 11.7 kg and 27.2 ± 4.2 kg/m2, respectively. The variables that were associated to complication in a bivariate analysis were: sleep apnea (p<0.028), outpatient surgery (p<0.017), blood transfusion (p<0.013), pre-bariatric weight (p=0.019) post-bariatric weight (p<0.001), surgical time (p<0.001), hospital stay (p<0.001), postsurgical hemoglobin (p<0.007) and resected tissue (p<0.012).

Plast. Ibero-Latinoam.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055175144,"Background and Objective. Excessive weight loss after bariatric surgery results in skin excess. Body contouring surgery corrects the functional and esthetic problems of these patients, although it has its complications. Our objective is to identify the associated factors for complications in patients undergoing post-bariatric contouring surgery. Demographics, comorbidities and surgical data were analyzed in a population sample collected among patients operated at our academic center in Medellín, Colombia. Methods. Retrospective and prospective data of 627 procedures in 512 patients were collected in a 4 years period. After a bivariate analysis, variables with a p ?0.25 were selected for the multivariate analysis. Logistic regression was estimated, proved and adjusted to identify independent variables associated with complications. Results. Of the 512 patients accepted, 67 procedures (10.7%) had a complication. Mean age was 41.22 ± 9.9 years. Mean pre-bariatric weight and body mass index (BMI) were 111.3 ± 19.6 kg and 46.1 ± 10.8 kg/m2 respectively. Mean post-bariatric weight and BMI were 69.9 ± 11.7 kg and 27.2 ± 4.2 kg/m2, respectively. The variables that were associated to complication in a bivariate analysis were: sleep apnea (p<0.028), outpatient surgery (p<0.017), blood transfusion (p<0.013), pre-bariatric weight (p=0.019) post-bariatric weight (p<0.001), surgical time (p<0.001), hospital stay (p<0.001), postsurgical hemoglobin (p<0.007) and resected tissue (p<0.012). Multivariate analysis evidenced the following independent variables: hospital stay (OR 1.7, IC 95%: 1.19-2.51, p<0.004), and post-bariatric weight (OR 14.72, IC 95%: 3.08-70.41, p<0.001). No cases of pulmonary embolism, Intensive Care Unit admission, nor death. Conclusions. The rate of complication of our population study was low.

Methods: An observational, retrospective study, in which the incidence of taeniasis and cysticercosis (ICD-10 codes B68s/B69s) in Colombia, 2009–2013, was estimated based on data extracted from the Individual Health Records System (Registro Individual de Prestación de Servicios, RIPS) was performed. The Geographic Information System (GIS) generated national maps showing the distribution of taeniasis and cysticercosis by department by year. Results: During the period, 3626 cases were reported (median 796/year), for a cumulative crude national rate of 7.7 cases/100,000pop; 58.2% corresponded to male; 57% were <40 year-old (10.2% < 9.9 year-old). Cases were 57.6% neurocysticercosis, the rest were taeniasis due to T. solium, T. saginata, ocular cysticercosis and cysticerci in other organs. Bolivar, a touristic department, had the highest cumulated incidence rate (16.17 cases/100,000pop), as also evident across the map series developed in this study. Conclusion: Despite the limitations of this study, data presented provide recent estimates of national taeniasis and cysticercosis incidence in the country useful in public health and for travel medicine practitioners, as some highly touristic areas presented higher disease incidence. Improved control, particularly of taeniasis, should be an attainable goal, which among other strategies would require improved sanitation and health education to prevent transmission, but also enhanced surveillance.

Lithium is the best-established long-term treatment for BD, even though individual response is highly variable. Evidence suggests that some of this variability has a genetic basis. This is supported by the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of lithium response to date conducted by the International Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLiGen). Recently, we performed the first genome-wide analysis of the involvement of miRNAs in BD and identified nine BD-associated miRNAs. However, it is unknown whether these miRNAs are also associated with lithium response in BD. In the present study, we therefore tested whether common variants at these nine candidate miRNAs contribute to the variance in lithium response in BD. Furthermore, we systematically analyzed whether any other miRNA in the genome is implicated in the response to lithium. For this purpose, we performed gene-based tests for all known miRNA coding genes in the ConLiGen GWAS dataset (n = 2,563 patients) using a set-based testing approach adapted from the versatile gene-based test for GWAS (VEGAS2). In the candidate approach, miR-499a showed a nominally significant association with lithium response, providing some evidence for involvement in both development and treatment of BD. In the genome-wide miRNA analysis, 71 miRNAs showed nominally significant associations with the dichotomous phenotype and 106 with the continuous trait for treatment response. A total of 15 miRNAs revealed nominal significance in both phenotypes with miR-633 showing the strongest association with the continuous trait (p = 9.80E-04) and miR-607 with the dichotomous phenotype (p = 5.79E-04). No association between miRNAs and treatment response to lithium in BD in either of the tested conditions withstood multiple testing correction. Given the limited power of our study, the investigation of miRNAs in larger GWAS samples of BD and lithium response is warranted.

In this study, we evaluated the replicative capacity of strains isolated in Medellin between 2003 and 2007 in C6/36 cells and in colonies of Aedes aegypti collected during 2010–2011 from high or low-incidence areas within the same city. The phylogenetic analysis grouped isolates according to the predominant genotypes found in the Americas, and the in vitro characterization showed differences in the morphological changes induced by the isolates of each of the isolated serotypes compared to the reference serotypes. In vitro replicative capacity studies demonstrated that genomic copy number increased at four days post-infection and that cell viability decreased significantly compared to the control for all serotypes. The largest number of genomic copies in C6/36 was produced by DENV-2, followed by DENV-1 and DENV-4; DENV-3 produced the smallest number of genomic copies and had the smallest negative effect on cell viability. Finally, differences in the in vivo replication of intercolonial serotypes between the Rockefeller colony and the field colonies and among the intracolonial serotypes were found. The replication of DENV-2 at 7 and 14 days in both high- and low-incidence colonies was higher than that of the other serotypes, and replication of DENV-3 in the mosquito colonies was the most stable on the days evaluated. Our results support the notion that replication and, possibly, DENV transmission and severity depend on many factors, including serotype and vector characteristics.

J. Infect. Dis.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052879769,"Dengue, the most prevalent arboviral disease worldwide, is caused by any of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes that co-circulate constantly in hyperendemic areas such as Medellin (Colombia), and these serotypes are transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. In this study, we evaluated the replicative capacity of strains isolated in Medellin between 2003 and 2007 in C6/36 cells and in colonies of Aedes aegypti collected during 2010–2011 from high or low-incidence areas within the same city. The phylogenetic analysis grouped isolates according to the predominant genotypes found in the Americas, and the in vitro characterization showed differences in the morphological changes induced by the isolates of each of the isolated serotypes compared to the reference serotypes. In vitro replicative capacity studies demonstrated that genomic copy number increased at four days post-infection and that cell viability decreased significantly compared to the control for all serotypes. The largest number of genomic copies in C6/36 was produced by DENV-2, followed by DENV-1 and DENV-4; DENV-3 produced the smallest number of genomic copies and had the smallest negative effect on cell viability. Finally, differences in the in vivo replication of intercolonial serotypes between the Rockefeller colony and the field colonies and among the intracolonial serotypes were found. The replication of DENV-2 at 7 and 14 days in both high- and low-incidence colonies was higher than that of the other serotypes, and replication of DENV-3 in the mosquito colonies was the most stable on the days evaluated. Our results support the notion that replication and, possibly, DENV transmission and severity depend on many factors, including serotype and vector characteristics. "

In an effort to identify commonalities across studies, we perform what we believe is the first ever large-scale coordinated study of WM microstructural differences in schizophrenia. Our analysis consisted of 2359 healthy controls and 1963 schizophrenia patients from 29 independent international studies; we harmonized the processing and statistical analyses of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data across sites and meta-analyzed effects across studies. Significant reductions in fractional anisotropy (FA) in schizophrenia patients were widespread, and detected in 20 of 25 regions of interest within a WM skeleton representing all major WM fasciculi. Effect sizes varied by region, peaking at (d=0.42) for the entire WM skeleton, driven more by peripheral areas as opposed to the core WM where regions of interest were defined. The anterior corona radiata (d=0.40) and corpus callosum (d=0.39), specifically its body (d=0.39) and genu (d=0.37), showed greatest effects. Significant decreases, to lesser degrees, were observed in almost all regions analyzed. Larger effect sizes were observed for FA than diffusivity measures; significantly higher mean and radial diffusivity was observed for schizophrenia patients compared with controls. No significant effects of age at onset of schizophrenia or medication dosage were detected. As the largest coordinated analysis of WM differences in a psychiatric disorder to date, the present study provides a robust profile of widespread WM abnormalities in schizophrenia patients worldwide.

The survey was anonimous and individual. The results were analyzed using Excel 2007 and STATA 2000. We analyzed 96 surveys, 29 from general practitioners and 67 medical specialists. Physicians had wrong knowledge about antibiotic use between 29,2% and 67,42%. Most physicians (97.4%) considered the antibiotics have to be sold only under medical prescription. Many physicians recognized having limited knowledge about antibiotic dosing interval and security. 60% physicians disagreed with the application of guidelines from other countries in our enviroment and 76% physician consider the infectious disease experts contribute to clinical management of patients. Physicians reported having support from an infectious disease expert on 72%, and had strategies to restrict the use of some antibiotics, likecontact isolation when multi-resistant organisms had been suspected.

The survey was anonimous and individual. The results were analyzed using Excel 2007 and STATA 2000. We analyzed 96 surveys, 29 from general practitioners and 67 medical specialists. Physicians had wrong knowledge about antibiotic use between 29,2% and 67,42%. Most physicians (97.4%) considered the antibiotics have to be sold only under medical prescription. Many physicians recognized having limited knowledge about antibiotic dosing interval and security. 60% physicians disagreed with the application of guidelines from other countries in our enviroment and 76% physician consider the infectious disease experts contribute to clinical management of patients. Physicians reported having support from an infectious disease expert on 72%, and had strategies to restrict the use of some antibiotics, likecontact isolation when multi-resistant organisms had been suspected.

Historically, 84 countries have reported vector-borne ZIKV transmission, 61 of which report on-going transmission. It is a Flavivirus transmitted through arthropods belonging to the Aedes genus. Since 2015, ZIKV infections have increased dramatically; with 1.3 million people infected during 2015 in Brazil alone. This paper's objective is to highlight the conjectural epidemiological points of the virus' dissemination. The digital archives Pubmed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane were searched for papers that assessed aspects of ZIKV transmission and epidemiology. The first isolation occurred in Uganda in 1947. Since then, important outbreaks were documented globally. Consequently, an emergent public health problem arose from a rapidly increasing incidence and its association with the development of neurological diseases such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Key factors in the successful containment of outbreaks include surveillance of mosquitos in the neighbourhood, an early mosquito control treatment, an assertive information campaign, and the involvement of the local population and healthcare workers. As such, while ZIKV seems to be spreading globally in a similar manner to other arboviruses, such as Dengue and Chikungunya viruses, it can also be rapidly contained due to the pre-existing availability of necessary resources and regulatory tools as control measures. This review aims to provide a description of those characteristics of ZIKV infection that may be useful in the construction of effective outbreak control strategies.

However, most of these methods demonstrate poor reproducibility that limit their reliability for clinical use. Inter-centre differences in study protocols, modelling approaches and default parameter settings have all led to a lack of standardisation and comparability between studies. We evaluated reproducibility of dCA parameters by assessing systematic errors in surrogate data resulting from different modelling techniques. Approach: Fourteen centres analysed 22 datasets consisting of two repeated physiological blood pressure measurements with surrogate cerebral blood flow velocity signals, generated using Tiecks curves (autoregulation index, ARI 0-9) and added noise. For reproducibility, dCA methods were grouped in three broad categories: 1. Transfer function analysis (TFA)-like output; 2. ARI-like output; 3. Correlation coefficient-like output. For all methods, reproducibility was determined by one-way intraclass correlation coefficient analysis (ICC). Main results: For TFA-like methods the mean (SD; [range]) ICC gain was 0.71 (0.10; [0.49-0.86]) and 0.80 (0.17; [0.36-0.94]) for VLF and LF (p = 0.003) respectively. For phase, ICC values were 0.53 (0.21; [0.09-0.80]) for VLF, and 0.92 (0.13; [0.44-1.00]) for LF (p < 0.001). Finally, ICC for ARI-like methods was equal to 0.84 (0.19; [0.41-0.94]), and for correlation-like methods, ICC was 0.21 (0.21; [0.056-0.35]). Significance: When applied to realistic surrogate data, free from the additional exogenous influences of physiological variability on cerebral blood flow, most methods of dCA modelling showed ICC values considerably higher than what has been reported for physiological data. This finding suggests that the poor reproducibility reported by previous studies may be mainly due to the inherent physiological variability of cerebral blood flow regulatory mechanisms rather than related to (stationary) random noise and the signal analysis methods.

Methods: Structural and practical identifiability analysis were performed on three published control-oriented models for glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D): the subcutaneous oral glucose minimal model (SOGMM), the intensive control insulin-nutrition-glucose (ICING) model, and the minimal model control-oriented (MMC). Structural identifiability was addressed with a combination of the generating series (GS) approach and identifiability tableaus whereas practical identifiability was studied by means of (1) global ranking of parameters via sensitivity analysis together with the Latin hypercube sampling method (LHS) and (2) collinearity analysis among parameters. For practical identifiability and model identification, continuous glucose monitor (CGM), insulin pump, and meal records were selected from a set of patients (n = 5) on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) that underwent a clinical trial in an outpatient setting. The performance of the identified models was analyzed by means of the root mean square (RMS) criterion. Results: A reliable set of identifiable parameters was found for every studied model after analyzing the possible identifiability issues of the original parameter sets. According to an importance factor ((Formula presented.)), it was shown that insulin sensitivity is not the most influential parameter from the dynamical point of view, that is, is not the parameter impacting the outputs the most of the three models, contrary to what is assumed in the literature. For the test data, the models demonstrated similar performance with most RMS values around 20 mg/dl (min: 15.64 mg/dl, max: 51.32 mg/dl). However, MMC failed to identify the model for patient 4. Also, considering the three models, the MMC model showed the higher parameter variability when reidentified every 6 hours. Conclusion: This study shows that both structural and practical identifiability analysis need to be considered prior to the model identification/individualization in patients with T1D. It was shown that all the studied models are able to represent the CGM data, yet their usefulness in a hypothetical artificial pancreas could be a matter of debate. In spite that the three models do not capture all the dynamics and metabolic effects as a maximal model (ie, our FDA-accepted UVa/Padova simulator), SOGMM and ICING appear to be more appealing than MMC regarding both the performance and parameter variability after reidentification. Although the model predictions of ICING are comparable to the ones of the SOGMM model, the large parameter set makes the model prone to overfitting if all parameters are identified.

The main contribution of this work is a variant of the algebraic identification methodology, which involves the use of generalized proportional integral observers (GPI). These observers are responsible for providing the estimation of the time-derivatives of the system outputs for their direct computation in the cases where there are non-linear operations with difficult analytical manipulation.

The main contribution of this work is a variant of the algebraic identification methodology, which involves the use of generalized proportional integral observers (GPI). These observers are responsible for providing the estimation of the time-derivatives of the system outputs for their direct computation in the cases where there are non-linear operations with difficult analytical manipulation.

In this work, we conducted a time-resolved triple-step inter-critical tempering, specially designed to obtain maximum austenite stability and minimum hardness through the progressive suppression of the martensitic transformation. The mechanism behind the progressive increase in stable reverted austenite was the generation of a meta-equilibrium state, which imposed a limit in both high temperature austenite reversion and room temperature austenite stabilization. Such limit corresponded to the high temperature volume fraction of austenite, obtained right before cooling from the first cycle. This effect was associated to the Ni-rich fresh martensite laths acting as local Ni compositional pockets, providing site-specific austenite reversion; and to the suppression of any additional nucleation at the Ni-poor matrix as the T0 temperature for austenite reversion was strongly increased. The softening mechanism was mainly controlled by the carbon arrest effect by the precipitation of Ti (C, N), which was completed after the first tempering cycle.

For that, we employed the wavelength-tunable femtosecond Z-scan technique and the parabolic effective-mass approximation model, in which the excitonic transition energies were phenomenologically corrected due to the stoichiometry of the nanocrystal. This model considers a conduction band and three valence sub-bands allowing excitonic transitions via centrosymmetric (?l = ±1, where l is the angular momentum of the absorbing state) and non-centrosymmetric (?l = 0) channels. In such case, this became relevant because the CIS QDs with chalcopyrite crystalline structure is a non-centrosymmetric semiconductor. Thus, our experimental results pointed out two 2 PA allowed bands located at 715 nm (2hv = 3.47 eV) and 625 nm (2hv = 3.97 eV) with cross sections of (6.3 ± 1.0) x 102 GM and (4.5 ± 0.7) x 102 GM, respectively. According to the theoretical model, these 2 PA bands can be ascribed to the 1P1/2(h3) ? 1S3/2(e) (lower energy band) and 1P1/2(hheavy) ? 1S3/2(e) (90%)/(10%)1P1/2(hsplit-off) ? 1P3/2(e) (higher energy band) excitonic transitions. A good agreement (magnitude and spectral position) between the experimental and theoretical data were obtained.

The correlation was strong and positive at this same point (r                             2                              = 0.65). In the dispersion analysis, the impact of marine aerosols was observed more than 20 km from the beach in the direction of the wind, with levels between 1.65 g/m                             3                              y 15.02 g/m                             3                             .

It was found that the contribution of marine aerosols to the mass of PM10 can be significant, reaching between 20% and 27%.
